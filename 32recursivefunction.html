   /*  JavaScript recursive functions */
//A recursive function is a function that calls itself until it doesn’t. This technique is called recursion.

//Suppose that you have a function called recurse(). The recurse() is a recursive function if it calls itself inside its body, like this:

function recurse() {
    // ...
    recurse();
    // ...
}

//A recursive function always has a condition to stop calling itself. Otherwise, it will call itself indefinitely. So a recursive function typically looks like the following:

function recurse() {
    if(condition) {
        // stop calling itself
        //...
    } else {
        recurse();
    }
}

//Generally, you use recursive functions to break down a big problem into smaller ones. Typically, you will find the recursive functions in data structures like binary trees and graphs and algorithms such as binary search and quicksort.

//JavaScript recursive function examples
//Let’s take some examples of using recursive functions.

//1) A simple JavaScript recursive function example
//Suppose that you need to develop a function that counts down from a specified number to 1. For example, to count down from 3 to 1:

3
2
1

//The following shows the countDown() function:

function countDown(fromNumber) {
    console.log(fromNumber);
}

countDown(3);
//This countDown(3) shows only the number 3.

//To count down from the number 3 to 1, you can:

// show the number 3.
// and call the countDown(2) that shows the number 2.
// and call the countDown(1) that shows the number 1.
// The following changes the countDown() to a recursive function:

function countDown(fromNumber) {
    console.log(fromNumber);
    countDown(fromNumber-1);
}

countDown(3);

//This countDown(3) will run until the call stack size is exceeded, like this:
//Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded.

//… because it doesn’t have the condition to stop calling itself.

//The countdown will stop when the next number is zero. Therefore, you add an if condition as follows:

function countDown(fromNumber) {
    console.log(fromNumber);

    let nextNumber = fromNumber - 1;

    if (nextNumber > 0) {
        countDown(nextNumber);
    }
}
countDown(3);

Output:
3
2
1

//The countDown() seems to work as expected.

//However, as mentioned in the Function type tutorial, the function’s name is a reference to the actual function object.

//If the function name is set to null somewhere in the code, the recursive function will stop working.

//For example, the following code will result in an error:

//let newYearCountDown = countDown;
// somewhere in the code
countDown = null;
// the following function call will cause an error
newYearCountDown(10);

//Error:Uncaught TypeError: countDown is not a function

//How the script works:

// First, assign the countDown function name to the variable newYearCountDown.
// Second, set the countDown function reference to null.
// Third, call the newYearCountDown function.
// The code causes an error because the body of the countDown() function references the countDown function name, which was set to null at the time of calling the function.

//To fix it, you can use a named function expression as follows:

let countDown = function f(fromNumber) {
    console.log(fromNumber);

    let nextNumber = fromNumber - 1;

    if (nextNumber > 0) {
        f(nextNumber);
    }
}

let newYearCountDown = countDown;
countDown = null;
newYearCountDown(10);


// 2) Calculate the sum of n natural numbers example
// Suppose you need to calculate the sum of natural numbers from 1 to n using the recursion technique. To do that, you need to define the sum() recursively as follows:

sum(n) = n + sum(n-1)
sum(n-1) = n - 1 + sum(n-2)

sum(1) = 1

// The following illustrates the sum() recursive function:

function sum(n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
  }
  return n + sum(n - 1);
}

//Base Case:

// The function starts with an if statement that checks if n is less than or equal to 1.
// If n is 1 or less, the function returns n. This is the base case, which serves as the stopping condition for the recursion.
// Recursive Case:

// When n is greater than 1, the base case is not met; the function enters the block after the if statement.
// The function returns the sum of n and the result of calling itself with the argument (n - 1). This is where the recursion happens.
// How it Works:

// For example, if you call sum(3), the function first checks if 3 is less than or equal to 1 (base case not met).
// Since it’s not the base case, it calculates 3 + sum(2). Now, it calls itself with the argument 2.
// In the next recursive call with sum(2), it calculates 2 + sum(1).
// Again, in the next recursive call with sum(1), it reaches the base case and returns 1.
// Now, the previous calls are resolved: 2 + 1 gives 3, and 3 + 3 gives the final result of 6.
// Termination:

// The recursion keeps happening, reducing the problem to smaller subproblems until it reaches the base case.
// Once the base case is reached, the function starts to unwind, combining the results from each level of recursion until the final result is obtained.
