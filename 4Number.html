/* JavaScript uses the number type to represent both integers and floating-point values. Technically, the JavaScript number type uses the IEEE-754 format.

ES2020 introduced a new primitive type bigint representing big integer numbers with values larger than 253 – 1.

To support various types of numbers, JavaScript uses different number literal formats.*/

//Integer numbers
//The following shows how to declare a variable that holds a decimal integer:
let counter = 100;

/*Integers can be represented in the following formats:

Octal (base 8)
Hexadecimal (based 16)
When you use the octal and hexadecimal numbers in arithmetic operations, JavaScript treats them as decimal numbers.*/

//Octal numbers
//An octal literal number starts with the digit zero (0) followed by a sequence of octal digits (numbers from 0 through 7). For example:

//let num = 071;
//console.log(num);  //output:80

//If an octal number contains a number not in the range from 0 to 7, the JavaScript engine ignores the 0 and treats the number as a decimal. For example:

// let num = 080;
// console.log(num); //output:80

//This implicit behavior might cause issues. Therefore, ES6 introduced a new octal literal that starts with the 0o followed by a sequence of octal digits (from 0 to 7). For example:

let num = 0o71;
console.log(num);  //output:57

// If you have an invalid number after 0o, JavaScript will issue a syntax error like this:

// let num = 0o80;
// console.log(num);

//Hexadecimal numbers
//Hexadecimal numbers start with 0x or 0X followed by any number of hexadecimal digits (0 through 9, and a through f). For example:

let Hexnum = 0x1a;
console.log(Hexnum); //output:26


//Floating-point numbers
//To define a floating-point literal number, you include a decimal point and at least one number after that. For example:
let price = 9.99;
let tax = 0.08;
let discount = .05; // valid but not recommeded

//When you have a very big number, you can use e-notation. E-notation indicates a number should be multiplied by 10 raised to a given power. For example:
let amount = 3.14e7;
console.log(amount);

//Output:31400000

//The notation 3.14e7 means that take 3.14 and multiply it by 107.

// Likewise, you can use the E-notation to represent a very small number. For example:

// let amount = 5e-7; 
// console.log(amount); //output : 0.0000005

//The 5e-7 notation means that take 5 and divide it by 10,000,000.

//Also, JavaScript automatically converts any floating-point number with at least six zeros after the decimal point into e-notation. For example:

let amt = 0.0000005;
console.log(amt); //output:5e-7

//Floating-point numbers are accurate up to 17 decimal places. When you perform arithmetic operations on floating-point numbers, you often get the approximate result. For example:
let sum = 0.2 + 0.1;
console.log(sum);

//Output:0.30000000000000004

//Big Integers
//JavaScript introduced the bigint type starting in ES2022. The bigint type stores whole numbers whose values are greater than 253 – 1.

//A big integer literal has the n character at the end of an integer literal like this:

let pageView = 9007199254740991n;
