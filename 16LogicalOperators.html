/*JavaScript logical operators*/

//the JavaScript logical operators including the logical NOT operator( !), the logical AND operator ( &&) and the logical OR operator ( ||).

//The logical operators are important in JavaScript because they allow you to compare variables and do something based on the result of that comparison.

//For example, if the result of the comparison is true, you can run a block of code; if it’s false, you can execute another code block.

/*
JavaScript provides three logical operators:

! (Logical NOT)
|| (Logical OR)
&& (Logical AND)

*/
/*1) The Logical NOT operator (!)*/
//JavaScript uses an exclamation point ! to represent the logical NOT operator. The ! operator can be applied to a single value of any type, not just a Boolean value.

//When you apply the ! operator to a boolean value, the ! returns true if the value is false and vice versa. For example:

let eligible = false,
    required = true;

console.log(!eligible);
console.log(!required);

Output:
true
false

//In this example, the eligible is true so !eligible returns false. And since the required is true, the !required returns false.

//When you apply the ! operator to a non-Boolean value. The ! operator converts the value to a boolean value and then negates it.

//The following example shows how to use the ! operator:
!a
/*
The logical ! operator works based on the following rules:

If a is undefined, the result is true.
If a is null, the result is true.
If a is a number other than 0, the result is false.
If a is NaN, the result is true.
If a is an object, the result is false.
If a is an empty string, the result is true. If a is a non-empty string, the result is false
*/ 

//The following demonstrates the results of the logical ! operator when applying to a non-boolean value:

console.log(!undefined); // true
console.log(!null); // true
console.log(!20); //false
console.log(!0); //true
console.log(!NaN); //true
console.log(!{}); // false
console.log(!''); //true
console.log(!'OK'); //false
console.log(!false); //true
console.log(!true); //false

//Double-negation (!!)
//Sometimes, you may see the double negation (!!) in the code. The !! uses the logical NOT operator (!) twice to convert a value to its real boolean value.

//The result is the same as using the Boolean() function. For example:

let counter = 10;
console.log(!!counter); // true

//The first ! operator negates the Boolean value of the counter variable. If the counter is true, then the ! operator makes it false and vice versa.

//The second ! operator negates the result of the first ! operator and returns the real boolean value of the counter variable.

/*2) The Logical AND operator (&&)*/
//JavaScript uses the double ampersand (&&) to represent the logical AND operator. The following expression uses the && operator:

//let result = a && b;

//If a can be converted to true, the && operator returns the b; otherwise, it returns the a. This rule is applied to all boolean values.

/*
The following truth table illustrates the result of the && operator when it is applied to two Boolean values:

a	     b	    a && b
true	true	true
true	false	false
false	true	false
false	false	false

*/
//The result of the && operator is true only if both values are true, otherwise, it is false. For example:

// let eligible = false,
//     required = true;

console.log(eligible && required); // false

//In this example, the eligible is false, therefore, the value of the expression eligible && required is false.

//See the following example:

// let eligible = true,
//     required = true;

console.log(eligible && required); // true

//In this example, both eligible and required are true, therefore, the value of the expression eligible && required is true.

//Short-circuit evaluation
//The && operator is short-circuited. It means that the && operator evaluates the second value only if the first one doesn’t suffice to determine the value of an expression. For example:

// let b = true;
// let result = b && (1 / 0);
console.log(result);

Output:
Infinity

//In this example, b is true therefore the && operator could not determine the result without further evaluating the second expression (1/0).

//The result is Infinity which is the result of the expression (1/0). However:

// let b = false;
// let result = b && (1 / 0);
console.log(result);
Output:
false

//In this case, b is false, the && operator doesn’t need to evaluate the second expression because it can determine the final result as false based value of the first value.

//The chain of && operators
//The following expression uses multiple && operators:

//let result = value1 && value2 && value3;

/*
The && operator carries the following:

Evaluates values from left to right.
For each value, convert it to a boolean. If the result is false, stops and returns the original value.
If all values are truthy values, return the last value.
*/
//In other words, The && operator returns the first falsey value or the last truthy value.

//If a value can be converted to true, it is called a truthy value. If a value can be converted to false, it is a called a falsey value.

/*3) The Logical OR operator (||)*/
//JavaScript uses the double-pipe || to represent the logical OR operator. You can apply the || operator to two values of any type:

//let result = a || b;

//If a can be converted to true, returns a; else, returns b. This rule is also applied to boolean values.

/*
The following truth table illustrates the result of the || operator based on the value of the operands:

a	     b	    a || b
true	true	true
true	false	true
false	true	true
false	false	false

*/
//The || operator returns false if both values are evaluated to false. In case either value is true, the || operator returns true. For example:

// let eligible = true,
//     required = false;

console.log(eligible || required); // true

//See another example:

// let eligible = false,
//     required = false;

console.log(eligible || required); // false

//In this example, the expression eligible || required returns false because both values are false.

//The || operator is also short-circuited
//Similar to the && operator, the || operator is short-circuited. It means that if the first value evaluates to true, the && operator doesn’t evaluate the second one.

//The chain of || operators
//The following example shows how to use multiple || operators in an expression:

let result = value1 || value2 || value3;
/*
The || operator does the following:

Evaluates values from left to right.
For each value, convert it to a boolean value. If the result of the conversion is true, stops and returns the value.
If all values have been evaluated to false, returns the last value.
*/
//In other words, the chain of the || operators returns the first truthy value or the last one if no truthy value is found.

//Logical operator precedence
//When you mix logical operators in an expression, the JavaScript engine evaluates the operators based on a specified order. This order is called the operator precedence.

//In other words, the operator precedence is the order of evaluating logical operators in an expression.
/*
The precedence of the logical operator is in the following order from the highest to the lowest:

Logical NOT (!)
Logical AND (&&)
Logical OR (||)
*/
