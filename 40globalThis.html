  /*   JavaScript globalThis object  */
//ES2020 introduced the globalThis object that provides a standard way to access the global object across environments.

//Historically, JavaScript had a global object with different names in different environments.

//In web browsers, the global object is window or frames.

//However, the Web Workers API doesnâ€™t have the window object because it has no browsing context. Hence, the Web Workers API uses self as a global object.

//Node.js, on the other hand, uses the global keyword to reference the global object.

/*
Environment	           Global
Web Browsers	        this
Web Workers	            self
Node.js	                global

//If you write JavaScript code that works across environments and needs to access the global object, you have to use different syntaxes like window, frames, self, or global.

//To standardize this, ES2020 introduced the globalThis that is available across environments.

//For example, the following code checks if the current environment supports the Fetch API:

const canFetch = typeof globalThis.fetch === 'function';

console.log(canFetch);

//The code checks if the fetch() function is a property of the global object. In the web browsers, the globalThis is the window object. Therefore, if you run this code on a modern web browser, the canFetch will be true.

//The following code returns true on the web browser:

globalThis === window

Output:
true
