 /*   JavaScript while loop statement */
//The JavaScript while statement creates a loop that executes a block as long as a condition evaluates to true.

//The following illustrates the syntax of the while statement:

while (expression) {
    // statement
}

//The while statement evaluates the expression before each iteration of the loop.

//If the expression evaluates to true, the while statement executes the statement. Otherwise, the while loop exits.

//Because the while loop evaluates the expression before each iteration, it is known as a pretest loop.

//If the expression evaluates to false before the loop enters, the while loop will never execute.

//Note that if you want to execute the statement a least once and check the condition after each iteration, you should use the do…while statement.


//JavaScript while loop examples
//Let’s take some examples of using the JavaScript while loop statement.

//Basic JavaScript while loop example
//The following example uses the while statement to output the odd numbers between 1 and 10 to the console:

let count = 1;
while (count < 10) {
    console.log(count);
    count +=2;
}

Output:

1
3
5
7
9

/*
How the script works

First, declare and initialize the count variable to 1:
let count = 1;

Second, execute the statement inside the loop if the count variable is less than 10. In each iteration, output the count to the console and increase the count by 2:
while (count < 10) {
    console.log(count);
    count +=2;
}

Third, after 5 iterations, the count is 11. Therefore, the condition count < 10 is false, the loop exits.
Calculating the sum of a sequence of numbers

*/
//The following example uses the while loop to calculate the sum of sequence of numbers from 1 to 100:

// let total = 0,
//   n = 100,
//   i = 0;

// while (i <= 100) {
//   total += i;
//   i++;
// }

console.log(total);

Output:
5050

//How it works.

//First, declare and initialize some variables:

// let total = 0,
//   n = 100,
//   i = 0;

// The total variable stores the sum of numbers between 1 and 100.
// The n variable serves as the ending number.
// The i variable is a loop variable.
// Second, add value of i to the total as long as i is less than or equal to 100:

while (i <= 100) {
  total += i;
  i++;
}

//Note that you need to increment i by one in each iteration. If you don’t do so, the condition i <= 100 will always true, which causes an indefinite loop.

//Third, display the total to the console:
console.log(total);

//Using while loop with an array
//The following example uses the while loop to iterate over elements of an array:

let mountains = ['Mount Everest', 'K2', 'Lhotse', 'Kangchenjunga'];
let i = 0;
while (i < mountains.length) {
  console.log(`${i + 1}.${mountains[i]}`);
  i++;
}

// Output:
// 1.Mount Everest
// 2.K2
// 3.Lhotse
// 4.Kangchenjunga


/*
How it works.

First, define an array that stores mountain names:
let mountains = ['Mount Everest', 'K2', 'Lhotse', 'Kangchenjunga'];

Second, declare and initialize a loop variable (i) to zero:
let i = 0;

Third, run the loop as long as the loop variable (i) is less than the number of elements in the mountains array:
while (i < mountains.length) {

Finally, show the mountain names and increment the loop variable (i) in each iteration:
  console.log(`${i + 1}.${mountains[i]}`);
  i++;
}

Since the mountains array has four elements, the while loop performs four iterations, each per element.
