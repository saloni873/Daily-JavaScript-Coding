  /*  JavaScript comma operator */
//JavaScript uses a comma (,) to represent the comma operator. A comma operator takes two expressions, evaluates them from left to right, and returns the value of the right expression.

//Hereâ€™s the syntax of the comma operator:

leftExpression, rightExpression

// For example:

let result = (10, 10 + 20);
console.log(result);

Output:
30

// In this example, the 10, 10+20 returns the value of the right expression, which is 10+20. Therefore, the result value is 30.

// See the following example:

let x = 10;
let y = (x++, x + 1);

console.log(x, y);

Output:
// 11 12

// In this example, we increment the value of x by one (x++), add one to x (x+1) and assign x to y. Therefore, x is 11, and y is 12 after the statement.

// However, to make the code more explicit, you can use two statements rather than one statement with a comma operator like this:

let a = 10;
a++;
let b = a + 1;

console.log(a, b);

// This code is more explicit.

// In practice, you might want to use the comma operator inside a for loop to update multiple variables each time through the loop.

// The following example uses the comma operator in a for loop to display an array of nine elements as a matrix of 3 rows and three columns:

let board = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
let s = '';

for (let i = 0, j = 1; i < board.length; i++, j++) {
  s += board[i] + ' ';
  if (j % 3 == 0) {
    console.log(s);
    s = '';
  }
}

// Output:
// 1 2 3
// 4 5 6
// 7 8 9

// How it works.

// First, define an array called board that stores numbers from 1 to 9, representing the board:
// let board = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

// Second, declare a variable and initialize its value to an empty string:
// let s = '';

// Third, declare two variables inside the loop. i for iterating over elements of board array and j is a counter that increments with each iteration:
// for (let i = 0, j = 1; i < board.length; i++, j++)

// Fourth, append each element in the board array and a space to the string s, display the s if the counter (j) is divisible by 3, and reset the string s:
// s += board[i] + ' ';
// if (j % 3 == 0) {
//   console.log(s);
//   s = '';
// }

// Finally, execute the loop body until all elements of the board array have been processed.
