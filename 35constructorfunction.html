 /*   JavaScript constructor functions */
//In the JavaScript objects tutorial, you learned how to use the object literal syntax to create a new object.

//For example, the following creates a new person object with two properties firstName and lastName:

let person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe'
};

//In practice, you often need to create many similar objects like the person object.

//To do that, you can use a constructor function to define a custom type and the new operator to create multiple objects from this type.

//Technically speaking, a constructor function is a regular function with the following convention:

// The name of a constructor function starts with a capital letter like Person, Document, etc.
// A constructor function should be called only with the new operator.


//The following example defines a constructor function called Person:

function Person(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
}

//In this example, the Person is the same as a regular function except that its name starts with the capital letter P.

//To create a new instance of the Person, you use the new operator:

//let person = new Person('John','Doe');

//Basically, the new operator does the following:

// Create a new empty object and assign it to the this variable.
// Assign the arguments 'John' and 'Doe' to the firstName and lastName properties of the object.
// Return the this value.
// It’s functionally equivalent to the following:

function Person(firstName, lastName) {
    // this = {};

    // add properties to this
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;

    // return this;
}

// Therefore, the following statement:
// let person = new Person('John','Doe');

//… returns the same result as the following statement:

// let person = {
//     firstName: 'John',
//     lastName: 'Doe'
// };

//However, the constructor function Person allows you to create multiple similar objects. For example:

let person1 = new Person('Jane','Doe')
let person2 = new Person('James','Smith')

//Adding methods to JavaScript constructor functions
//An object may have methods that manipulate its data. To add a method to an object created via the constructor function, you can use the this keyword. For example:

function Person(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;

    this.getFullName = function () {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    };
}

//Now, you can create a new Person object and invoke the getFullName() method:

// let person = new Person("John", "Doe");
console.log(person.getFullName());

Output:
// John Doe

// The problem with the constructor function is that when you create multiple instances of the Person, the this.getFullName() is duplicated in every instance, which is not memory efficient.

// To resolve this, you can use the prototype so that all instances of a custom type can share the same methods.

// Returning from constructor functions
// Typically, a constructor function implicitly returns this that set to the newly created object. But if it has a return statement, then here are the rules:

// If return is called with an object, the constructor function returns that object instead of this.
// If return is called with a value other than an object, it is ignored.
// Calling a constructor function without the new keyword
// Technically, you can call a constructor function like a regular function without using the new keyword like this:

// let person = Person('John','Doe');

// In this case, the Person just executes like a regular function. Therefore, the this inside the Person function doesn’t bind to the person variable but the global object.

// If you attempt to access the firstName or lastName property, you’ll get an error:

console.log(person.firstName);

Error:
//TypeError: Cannot read property 'firstName' of undefined

//Similarly, you cannot access the getFullName() method since it’s bound to the global object.

person.getFullName();

Error:
//TypeError: Cannot read property 'getFullName' of undefined

//To prevent a constructor function from being invoked without the new keyword, ES6 introduced the new.target property.

// If a constructor function is called with the new keyword, the new.target returns a reference of the function. Otherwise, it returns undefined.

// The following adds a statement to the Person function to show the new.target to the console:

function Person(firstName, lastName) {
    console.log(new.target);

    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName  = lastName;

    this.getFullName = function () {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    };
}

//The following returns undefined because the Person constructor function is called like a regular function:

// let person = Person("John", "Doe");

Output:
undefined

// However, the following returns a reference to the Person function because it’s called the new keyword:

//let person = new Person("John", "Doe");

Output:
// [Function: Person]

//By using the new.target, you can force the callers of the constructor function to use the new keyword. Otherwise, you can throw an error like this:

function Person(firstName, lastName) {
    if (!new.target) {
        throw Error("Cannot be called without the new keyword");
    }

    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
}

// Alternatively, you can make the syntax more flexible by creating a new Person object if the users of the constructor function don’t use the new keyword:

function Person(firstName, lastName) {
    if (!new.target) {
        return new Person(firstName, lastName);
    }

    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
}

//let person = Person("John", "Doe");

console.log(person.firstName);

//This pattern is often used in JavaScript libraries and frameworks to make the syntax more flexible.
