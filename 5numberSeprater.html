//JavaScript numeric separator
//The numeric separator allows you to create a visual separation between groups of digits by using underscores (_) as separators.

//For example, the following number is challenging to read especially when it contains long digit repetitions:

const budget = 1000000000;

//Is this a billion or a hundred million?

//The numeric separator fixes this readability issue as follows:

const bgt = 1_000_000_000;

//As you can see, the number is now very easy to interpret.

//JavaScript allows you to use numeric separators for both integer and floating-point numbers. For example:

let amount = 120_201_123.05; // 120201123.05
let expense = 123_450; // 123450
let fee = 12345_00; // 1234500

//It’s important to note that all numbers in JavaScript are floating-point numbers.

//Also, you can use the numeric separators for factional and exponent parts. For example:

let amt = 0.000_001; // 1 millionth

//It’s important to notice that you can use the numeric separator for bigint literal, binary literal, octal literal, and hex literal. For example:

// BigInt
const max = 9_223_372_036_854_775_807n;

// binary
let nibbles = 0b1011_0101_0101;

// octal
let val = 0o1234_5670;

// hex
let message = 0xD0_E0_F0;
