/*remainder operator*/
//JavaScript uses the % to represent the remainder operator. The remainder operator returns the remainder left over when one value is divided by another value.

//Here’s the syntax of the remainder operator:
//dividend % divisor


/*
The following shows the equation for the remainder:

dividend = divisor * quotient + remainder
where |remainder| < |divisor|
In this equation, the dividend, divisor, quotient, and remainder are all integers. The sign of the remainder is the same as the sign of the dividend.
*/
//JavaScript Remainder Operator
//JavaScript remainder operator examples
//Let’s take some examples of using the JavaScript remainder operator.

//Using the remainder operator with a positive dividend
//The following example shows how to use the remainder operator with a positive dividend:

/*
let remainder = 5 % -2;
console.log(remainder); // 1

remainder = 5 % 2;
console.log(remainder); // 1
*/

//Using the remainder operator with a negative dividend
//The following example uses the remainder operator with a negative dividend:

/*
let remainder = -5 % 3;
console.log(remainder); // -2

remainder = -5 % -3;
console.log(remainder); // -2
*/

//Using the remainder operator with special values
//If a dividend is an Infinity and a divisor is a finite number, the remainder is NaN. For example:

/*
let remainder = Infinity % 2;
console.log(remainder); // NaN

//If a dividend is a finite number and a divisor is zero, the remainder is NaN:

let remainder = 10 % 0;
console.log(remainder); // NaN
*/
//If both dividend and divisor are Infinity, the remainder is NaN:

/*
let remainder = Infinity % Infinity;
console.log(remainder); // NaN
*/
//If a dividend is a finite number and the divisor is an Infinity, the remainder is the dividend. For example:

/*
let remainder = 10 % Infinity;
console.log(remainder); // 10
*/
//If the dividend is zero and the divisor is non-zero, the remainder is zero:

/*
let remainder = 0 % 10;
console.log(remainder); // 0
*/
//If either dividend or divisor is not a number, it’s converted to a number using the Number() function and applied the above rules. For example:

let remainder = '10' % 3;
console.log(remainder); // 1

//Checking if a number is an odd number
//To check if a number is an odd number, you use the remainder operator (%) like the following example:

let num = 13;
let isOdd = num % 2 == 1;
console.log(isOdd); // true

//In this example, if the num is an odd number, the remainder is one. But if the num is an even number, the remainder is zero.

//Later, you’ll learn how to define a function that returns true if a number is odd or false otherwise like this:

function isOdd(num) {
  return num % 2;
}

//Alternatively, you can use an arrow function in ES6:

const isOdd = (num) => num % 2;

/*Remainder vs Modulo operator*/
//In JavaScript, the remainder operator (%) is not the modulo operator.

//If you have been working with Python, you may find the % represents the modulo operator. However, this is not the case in JavaScript.

//To get a modulo in JavaScript, you use the following expression:

((dividend % divisor) + divisor) % divisor
//Alternatively, you can wrap it in a function:

const mod = (dividend, divisor) => ((dividend % divisor) + divisor) % divisor;

//If the division and divisor have the same sign, the remainder and modulo operators return the same result. Otherwise, they return different results.
/*
For example:

const mod = (dividend, divisor) => ((dividend % divisor) + divisor) % divisor;
*/
// dividen and divisor have the same sign
console.log('remainder:', 5 % 3); // 2
console.log('modulo:', mod(5, 3)); // 2

// dividen and divisor have the different signs
console.log('remainder:', -5 % 3); // -2
console.log('modulo:', mod(-5, 3)); // 1

Output:
remainder: 2
modulo: 2
remainder: -2
modulo: 1
