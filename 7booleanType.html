//The JavaScript boolean primitive type has two literal values: true and false.

//The following example declares two variables and initializes their values to true and false:

let completed = true;
let running = false;

//The boolean’s literal values are case-sensitive. This means that the True and False are valid identifiers but they’re not boolean values.

//JavaScript allows the values of other types to be cast to boolean values. To cast a non-Boolean value to a boolean value, you use the built-in Boolean() function. For example:

//let error = 'An error occurred';
let hasError = Boolean(error);

console.log(hasError);

Output:
true

//How it works.

//First, declare a variable error that holds a literal string 'An error occurred':

//let error = 'An error occurred';

//Second, cast the error variable to a boolean value using the Boolean() function:

//let hasError = Boolean(error);

//Third, output the value of the hasError variable to the console:

console.log(hasError);

//Since the error variable holds a non-empty string, the Boolean() function casts its value to true.

//The following table shows how the Boolean() function casts the values of other types to boolean values:


//For example, the if statement executes a block if a condition is true. If you use a non-boolean value, it’ll use the Boolean() function to implicitly cast that value to a boolean value.



//See the following example:

//let error = 'An error occurred';

if (error) {
  console.log(error);
}

Output:

/*An error occurred
In this example, since the error variable holds a non-empty string, the if statement evaluates its value to true. Therefore, it executes the console.log(error) to output the error to the console.

If you change the value of the error variable to an empty string (""), you won’t see anything in the output because the if statement evaluates it as false: */

let error = '';
if (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
