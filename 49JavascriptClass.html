   // A JavaScript class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class encapsulates data and functions that manipulate data.

//Unlike other programming languages such as Java and C#, JavaScript classes are syntactic sugar over the prototypal inheritance. In other words, ES6 classes are just special functions.

/* Classes before ES6 revisited */
//Before ES6, JavaScript had no concept of classes. To mimic a class, you often use the constructor/prototype pattern as shown in the following example:

function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.getName = function () {
    return this.name;
};

var john = new Person("John Doe");
console.log(john.getName());


Output:
//John Doe

/*
How it works.

First, create the Person as a constructor function that has a property name called name. The getName() function is assigned to the prototype so that it can be shared by all instances of the Person type.

Then, create a new instance of the Person type using the new operator. The john object, hence, is an instance of the Person and Object through prototypal inheritance.

*/

//The following statements use the instanceof operator to check if john is an instance of the Person and Object type:

console.log(john instanceof Person); // true
console.log(john instanceof Object); // true

//ES6 class declaration
//ES6 introduced a new syntax for declaring a class as shown in this example:

class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    getName() {
        return this.name;
    }
}

//This Person class behaves like the Person type in the previous example. However, instead of using a constructor/prototype pattern, it uses the class keyword.

//In the Person class, the constructor() is where you can initialize the properties of an instance. JavaScript automatically calls the constructor() method when you instantiate an object of the class.

//The following creates a new Person object, which will automatically call the constructor() of the Person class:

let john = new Person("John Doe");

//The getName() is called a method of the Person class. Like a constructor function, you can call the methods of a class using the following syntax:

objectName.methodName(args)

//For example:

let name = john.getName();
console.log(name); // "John Doe"

//To verify the fact that classes are special functions, you can use the typeof operator of to check the type of the Person class.

console.log(typeof Person); // function

//It returns function as expected.

//The john object is also an instance of the Person and Object types:

console.log(john instanceof Person); // true
console.log(john instanceof Object); // true

/* Class vs. Custom type */
//Despite the similarities between a class and a custom type defined via a constructor function, there are some important differences.

//First, class declarations are not hoisted like function declarations.

//For example, if you place the following code above the Person class declaration section, you will get a ReferenceError.

let john = new Person("John Doe");

Error:
//Uncaught ReferenceError: Person is not defined

//Second, all the code inside a class automatically executes in the strict mode. And you cannot change this behavior.

//Third, class methods are non-enumerable. If you use a constructor/prototype pattern, you have to use the Object.defineProperty() method to make a property non-enumerable.

//Finally, calling the class constructor without the new operator will result in an error as shown in the following example.

let john = Person("John Doe");

//Error:
//Uncaught TypeError: Class constructor Person cannot be invoked without 'new'
