 /*   JavaScript prototypal inheritance  */
//If you’ve worked with other object-oriented programming languages such as Java or C++, you’ve been familiar with the inheritance concept.

//In this programming paradigm, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. If you want a new class to reuse the functionality of an existing class, you can create a new class that extends the existing class. This is called classical inheritance.

//JavaScript doesn’t use classical inheritance. Instead, it uses prototypal inheritance.

//In prototypal inheritance, an object “inherits” properties from another object via the prototype linkage.

//JavaScript prototypal inheritance and __proto__
//Let’s take an example to make the concept clear.

//The following defines a person object:

// let person = {
//     name: "John Doe",
//     greet: function () {
//         return "Hi, I'm " + this.name;
//     }
// };

//In this example, the person object has a property and a method:
//*name is a property that stores the person’s name.
//*greet is a method that returns a greeting as a string.

//By default, the JavaScript engine provides you with a built-in Object() function and an anonymous object that can be referenced by the Object.prototype:

//JavaScript Prototype


//The person object has a link to the anonymous object referenced by the Object() function. The [[Prototype]] represents the linkage:

//JavaScript prototypal inheritance
//It means that the person object can call any methods defined in the anonymous object referenced by the Object.prototype.

//For example, the following shows how to call the toString() method via the person object:

console.log(person.toString());

//Output:[object Object]

//The [object Object] is the default string representation of an object.

//When you call toString() method via person, the JavaScript engine cannot find it on the person object. Therefore, it follows the prototype chain and searches for the method in the Object.prototype object.

//Since the JavaScript engine can find the toString() method in the Object.prototype object, it executes the toString() method.

//To access the prototype of the person object, you can use the __proto__ property as follows

console.log(person.__proto__);

//Note that you should never use the __proto__ property in the production code. Please use it for demonstration purposes only.

//The following shows the person.__proto__ and Object.prototype references the same object:

console.log(person.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true

//The following defines the teacher object that has the teach() method:

let teacher = {
    teach: function (subject) {
        return "I can teach " + subject;
    }
};

//Like the person object, the teacher.__proto__ references the Object.prototype as illustrated in the following picture:

//If you want the teacher object to access all methods and properties of the person object, you can set the prototype of teacher object to the person object like this:

teacher.__proto__ = person;

//Now, the teacher object can access the name property and greet() method from the person object via the prototype chain:

console.log(teacher.name);
console.log(teacher.greet());

Output:
//John Doe
//Hi, I'm John Doe

//When you call the greet() method on the teacher object, the JavaScript engine finds it in the teacher object first.

//Since the JavaScript engine cannot find the method in the teacher object, it follows the prototype chain and searches for the method in the person object. Because the JavaScript engine can find the greet() method in the person object, it executes the method.

//In JavaScript, we say that the teacher object inherits the methods and properties of the person object. This kind of inheritance is called prototypal inheritance.

// A standard way to implement prototypal inheritance in ES5
// ES5 provided a standard way to work with prototypal inheritance by using the Object.create() method.

// Note that now you should use the newer ES6 class and extends keywords to implement inheritance. It’s much simpler.

// The Object.create() method creates a new object and uses an existing object as a prototype of the new object:

Object.create(proto, [propertiesObject])

// The Object.create() method accepts two arguments:

// The first argument (proto) is an object used as the prototype for the new object.
// The second argument (propertiesObject), if provided, is an optional object that defines additional properties for the new object.

// Suppose you have a person object:

let person = {
    name: "John Doe",
    greet: function () {
        return "Hi, I'm " + this.name;
    }
};

//The following creates an empty teacher object with the __proto__ of the person object:

let teacher = Object.create(person);

//After that, you can define properties for the teacher object:

teacher.name = 'Jane Doe';
teacher.teach = function (subject) {
        return "I can teach " + subject;
}

//Or you can do all of these steps in one statement as follows:

let teacher = Object.create(person, {
    name: { value: 'John Doe' } ,
    teach: { value: function(subject) {
        return "I can teach " + subject;
    }}
});

//ES5 also introduced the Object.getPrototypeOf() method that returns the prototype of an object. For example:

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(teacher) === person);

Output:
true
