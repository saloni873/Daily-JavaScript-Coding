   /*  JavaScript if…else statement */
//The if statement executes a block if a condition is true. When the condition is false, it does nothing.

//But if you want to execute a statement if the condition is false, you can use an if...else statement.

//Here’s the syntax of the if...else statement:

if( condition ) {
  // ...
} else { 
  // ...
}

//In this syntax, the condition is a value or an expression that evaluates to true or false. If the condition is true, the if...else statement executes the block that follows the if branch.

//If the condition is false, the if...else statement executes the block that follows the else branch.

//Typically, the condition evaluates to a boolean value, which is true or false. However, if it evaluates to a non-boolean value, the if...else statement will convert it to the boolean value.

//JavaScript if…else statement examples
//The following example uses the if...else statement to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18:

let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log('You can sign up.');
} else {
  console.log('You must be at least 18 to sign up.');
}

//In this example, the age is 18. Therefore, the expression age >= 18 is true. Hence, you’ll see the following message in the console:
//You can sign up.

//The following example is the same as above except that the age is 18 instead of 16:

// let age = 16;

// if (age >= 18) {
//   console.log('You can sign up.');
// } else {
//   console.log('You must be at least 18 to sign up.');
// }

//Output:
//You must be at least 18 to sign up.

//In this example, the age is 16. Therefore, the expression age >= 18 evaluates to false. Hence, the statement in the else branch executes that output the message to the console.

//The following example uses a logical operator AND (&&) as the condition in the if block:

// let age = 16;
// let country = 'USA';

// if (age >= 16 && country === 'USA') {
//   console.log('You can get a driving license.');
// } else {
//   console.log('You are not eligible to get a driving license.');
// }

//Because the age is 16 and the country is the USA, the following expression returns true.

//age >= 16 && country === 'USA'

// And you see the following output:
// You can get a driving license.
