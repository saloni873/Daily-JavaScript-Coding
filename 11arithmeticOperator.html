   /* JavaScript Arithmetic Operators*/
//JavaScript supports the following standard arithmetic operators:
/*
Operator	            Sign
Addition        - 	     +
Subtraction	    -        -
Multiplication  -	     *
Division	    -        /
*/

//An arithmetic operator accepts numerical values as operands and returns a single numerical value. The numerical values can be literals or variables.

//Addition operator (+)
//The addition operator returns the sum of two values. For example, the following uses the addition operator to calculate the sum of two numbers:

let sum = 10 + 20;
console.log(sum); // 30

//You can also use the addition operator with two variables. For example:

let netPrice    = 9.99,
    shippingFee = 1.99;
let grossPrice  = netPrice + shippingFee;

console.log(grossPrice);

Output:

11.98

//If either value is a string, the addition operator uses the following rules:

//If both values are strings, it concatenates the second string to the first one.
//If one value is a string, it implicitly converts the numeric value into a string and concatenates two strings.
//For example, the following uses the addition operator to concatenate two strings:

let x = '10',
    y = '20';
let res = x + y;

console.log(res);

Output:

1020
//The following example shows how to use the addition operator to calculate the sum of a number and a string:

let result = 10 + '20';

console.log(result);    

Output:

1020
//In this example, JavaScript converts the number 10 into a string '10' and concatenates the second string '20' to it.


/*Subtraction operator (-)*/
//The subtraction operator (-) subtracts one number from another. For example:

let rest = 30 - 10;
console.log(rest); // 20

//If a value is a string, a boolean, null, or undefined, the JavaScript engine will:

//First, convert the value to a number using the Number() function.
//Second, perform the subtraction.

/*Multiplication operator (*)*/
//JavaScript uses the asterisk (*) to represent the multiplication operator. The multiplication operator multiplies two numbers and returns a single value. For example:

let mul = 2 * 3;
console.log(mul);

Output:

6
//If either value is not a number, the JavaScript engine implicitly converts it into a number using the Number() function and perform the multiplication. For example:

let ret = '5' * 2;
console.log(ret);

Output:

10

/*Divide operator (/)*/
//Javascript uses the slash (/) character to represent the divide operator. The divide operator divides the first value by the second one. For example:

let rt = 20 / 10;
console.log(rt); // 2

//If either value is not a number, the JavaScript engine converts it into a number for division. For example:

let r = '20' / 2;
console.log(r); // 10;

/*Using JavaScript arithmetic operators with objects*/
//If a value is an object, the JavaScript engine will call the valueOf() method of the object to get the value for calculation. For example:

/*
let energy = {
  valueOf() {
    return 100;
  },
};

let currentEnergy = energy - 10;
console.log(currentEnergy);

currentEnergy = energy + 100;
console.log(currentEnergy);

currentEnergy = energy / 2;
console.log(currentEnergy);

currentEnergy = energy * 1.5;
console.log(currentEnergy);
*/
Output:

90
200
50
150

//If the object doesnâ€™t have the valueOf() method but has the toString() method, the JavaScript engine will call the toString() method to get the value for calculation. For example:

let energy = {
  toString() {
    return 50;
  },
};

let currentEnergy = energy - 10;
console.log(currentEnergy);

currentEnergy = energy + 100;
console.log(currentEnergy);

currentEnergy = energy / 2;
console.log(currentEnergy);

currentEnergy = energy * 1.5;
console.log(currentEnergy);

Output:

40
150
25
75
