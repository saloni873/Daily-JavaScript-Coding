   /* Unary operators */
//JavaScript unary operators work on one value. The following table shows the unary operators and their meanings:
/*
Unary Operators	            Name	                                             Meaning
       +x	             Unary Plus	                                    Convert a value into a number
       -x	             Unary Minus	                                Convert a value into a number and negate it
      ++x	             Increment Operator (Prefix)	                Add one to the value
      --x	             Decrement Operator (Prefix)	                Subtract one from the value
      x++	             Increment Operator (Postfix)	                Add one to the value
      x--	             Decrement Operator (Postfix)	                Subtract one from the value

//Unary plus (+)
//The unary plus operator is a simple plus sign (+). If you place the unary plus before a numeric value, it does nothing. For example

// let x = 10;
// let y = +x;

console.log(y); // 10
// When you apply the unary plus operator to a non-numeric value, it performs a number conversion using the Number() function with the following rules:
/*
  Value	                           Result
 boolean	                false to 0, true to 1
 string	                    Convert the string value based on a set of specific rules
 object	                    Call the valueOf() and/or toString() method to get the value to convert into a number

 */
//For example, the following uses the unary plus operator to convert the string '10' to the number 10:

let s = '10';
console.log(+s); // 10

//The following example uses the unary plus operator (+) converts a boolean value into a number, false to 0 and true to 1.

let f = false,
    t = true;

console.log(+f); // 0
console.log(+t); // 1

Output:
0
1
//Suppose you have a product object with the toString() method as follows:

// let person = {
//   name: 'John',
//   toString: function () {
//     return '25';
//   },
// };

console.log(+person);

Output:
25
//In this example, we apply the unary plus operator (+) on the person object that has the toString() method, JavaScript engine calls toString() method to get the value ('25') and convert it into a number.

//The following adds the valueOf() method to the person object:

let person = {
  name: 'John',
  toString: function () {
    return '25';
  },
  valueOf: function () {
    return '30';
  },
};

console.log(+person);

Output:
30
//In this example, the person object has the valueOf() method, the JavaScript engine calls it instead of the toString() method to get the value to convert.

/*Unary minus (-)*/
//The unary minus operator is a single minus sign (-). If you apply the unary minus operator to a number, it negates the number. For example:

let x = 10;
let y = -x;

console.log(y); // -10

//If you apply the unary minus operator to a non-numeric value, it converts the value into a number using the same rules as the unary plus operator and then negates the value.

/*Increment operator (++)*/
//The increment operator has two plus signs (++). It has two version: prefix and postfix.

Prefix:
++x;

Postfix:
x++;
//The following example uses the prefix increment operator to add one to a variable:

// let age = 25;
// ++age;
console.log(age); // 26

//It’s equivalent to the following:

let age = 25;
age = age + 1;
console.log(age); // 26

//When you use the prefix increment operator, JavaScript changes the variable before evaluating the statement. For example:

// let weight = 90;
// weight = ++weight + 5;
// console.log(weight); // 96

/*
In this example:

First, increase the weight on the right-hand side so ++weight is 91.
Second, add five to the ++weight that returns 96.
Third, assign the result to the weight on the left-hand side.
*/
/*Decrement operator (–)*/
//The decrement operator has two minus signs (--). Like the increment operator, it has two version: prefix and postfix.

Prefix:
--x

Postfix:
x--
//The following example uses the prefix decrement operator to subtract one from a variable:

// let weight = 90;
// --weight;

console.log(weight); // 89

//It is equivalent to the following:

// let weight = 90;
// weight = weight - 1;

console.log(weight); // 89

//Likewise, the following example uses a prefix decrement operator:

// let weight = 90;
// weight = --weight + 5;

console.log(weight); // 94
/*
In this example:

First, subtract one from the weight, --weight returns 89.
Second, add five to the --weight that returns 94.
Third, assign the result to the weight on the left-hand side.
The postfix increment or decrement operator changes the value after the statement is evaluated. For example:
*/

let weight = 90;
let newWeight = weight++ + 5;

console.log(newWeight); // 95
console.log(weight); // 91
/*
How it works.
First, add five to weight (90) and assign the result to the newWeight (95)
Second, add one to the weight variable after the second statement is completed, the weight becomes 91.
Third, display both newWeight and weight to the console.
When applying the increment/decrement operator to a non-numeric value, it performs the following steps :

First, convert the value into a number using the same rules as the unary plus (+) operator.
Then, add one to or subtract one from the value.
