/*Assignment operators*/
//In JavaScript, an assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.

//Here’s the syntax of the assignment operator:

let a = b;

//In this syntax, JavaScript evaluates the expression b first and assigns the result to the variable a.

//For example, the following declares the counter variable and initializes its value to zero:
//let counter = 0;

//The following example increases the counter variable by one and assigns the result to the counter variable:
//let counter = 0;
//counter = counter + 1;

//When evaluating the second statement, JavaScript evaluates the expression on the right-hand first (counter + 1) and assigns the result to the counter variable. After the second assignment, the counter variable is 1.

//To make the code more concise, you can use the += operator like this:

let counter = 0;
counter += 1;

//In this syntax, you don’t have to repeat the counter variable twice in the assignment.

//The following table illustrates assignment operators that are shorthand for another operator and the assignment:

Operator	            Meaning	                                Description
a = b	                 a = b	                        Assigns the value of b to a.
a += b	                 a = a + b	                    Assigns the result of a plus b to a.
a -= b	                 a = a - b	                    Assigns the result of a minus b to a.
a *= b	                 a = a * b	                    Assigns the result of a times b to a.
a /= b	                 a = a / b	                    Assigns the result of a divided by b to a.
a %= b	                 a = a % b	                    Assigns the remainder of a and b to a
a &=b	                 a = a & b	                    Assigns the result of a AND b to a.
a |=b	                 a = a | b	                    Assigns the result of a OR b to a.
a ^=b	                 a = a ^ b	                    Assigns the result of a XOR b to a.
a <<= b	                 a = a << b	                    Assigns the result of a shifted left by b to a.
a >>= b	                 a = a >> b	                    Assigns the result of a shifted right (sign preserved) by b to a.
a >>>= b	             a = a >>> b	                Assigns the result of a shifted right by b to a.

//+= operator
//The following example uses the += operator to add one to variable x:
/*
let x = 10;
x += 1;
console.log(x); // 11
*/

//-= operator
//The following example uses the -= operator to minus one from the variable x:
/*
let x = 10;
x -= 1;
console.log(x); // 9
*/
Output:
9

//*= operator
//The following example uses the *= operator to multiply 10 with the variable x:
/*
let x = 10;
x *= 10;
*/
console.log(x); // 100

///= operator
//The following example uses the /= operator to divide x by 2 and assign the result back to x:
/*
let x = 10;
x /= 2;
console.log(x); // 5
*/
Output:
5


//%= operator
//The following example uses the %= operator to get the remainder of x is divided by 2 and assigns the remainder back to x:

let x = 5;
x = x % 2;

console.log(x);

Output:
1

//Chaining JavaScript assignment operators
//If you want to assign a single value to multiple variables, you can chain the assignment operators. For example:

/*
let a = 10, b = 20, c = 30;
a = b = c; // all variables are 30
*/
//In this example, JavaScript evaluates from right to left. Therefore, it does the following:
/*
let a = 10, b = 20, c = 30;

b = c; // b is 30
a = b; // a is also 30 
*/
