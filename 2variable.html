//A variable is a label that references a value like a number or string. Before using a variable, you need to declare it.

//Declaring a variable
//To declare a variable, you use the var keyword followed by the variable name as follows:

var variableName;

// A variable name can be any valid identifier. For example:

var message;

// By default, a variable has a special value undefined if you don’t assign it a value.

// In JavaScript, variable names follow these rules:

// **Variable names are case-sensitive. This means that the message and Message are different variables.
//** Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs and cannot contain spaces. Also, variable names must begin with a letter, an underscore (_) or a dollar sign ($).
// **Variable names cannot use the reserved words.
// **By convention, variable names use camelCase like message, yourAge, and myName.

// JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means that you don’t need to explitly specify the variable’s type in the declaration like other static-typed languages such as Java or C#.

// Starting in ES6, you can use the let keyword to declare a variable like this:
let message;

// It’s a good practice to use the let keyword to declare a variable.

//Initializing a variable

//After declaring a variable, you can initialize it with a value. To initialize a variable, you specify the variable name, followed by an equals sign (=) and a value:

variableName = initialValue;

//For example, The following declares the message variable and initializes it with a literal string "Hello":
let message;
message = "Hello";

//To declare and initialize a variable at the same time, you use the following syntax:
let variableName = value;

//For example, the following statement declares the message variable and initializes it with the literal string "Hello":
let message = "Hello";

//JavaScript allows you to declare two or more variables using a single statement. To separate two variable declarations, you use a comma (,) like this:
let message = "Hello",counter = 100;

//Since JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, you can assign a value of a different type to a variable. Although, it is not recommended. For example:
let message = "Hello";
message = 100;

//In this example, we initialize the message variable with a literal string "Hello" to the messaage variable. Then, we assign a number 100 to it.

//Changing a variable
// After declaring or initializing a variable, you can change its value by setting a different value. For example:
let message = "Hello";
message = 'Bye';

// Undefined vs. undeclared variables
// It’s important to distinguish between undefined and undeclared variables.

// An undefined variable is a variable that has been declared but has not been initialized with a value. For example:
let message;
console.log(message); // undefined

// In this example, the message variable is declared but not initialized. Therefore, the message variable is undefined.

// In contrast, an undeclared variable is a variable that has not been declared. For example:

console.log(counter);

// In this example, the counter variable has not been declared. Hence, accessing it causes a ReferenceError

//Constants
//A constant holds a value that doesn’t change. To declare a constant, you use the const keyword. When defining a constant, you need to initialize it with a value immediately. For example:
const workday = 5;

// Once you define a constant, you cannot change its value.

// The following example attempts to change the value of the workday constant to 4 and causes an error:
workday = 2;

// Sometimes, you’ll see the constant names in uppercase like this:

const PORT = 3000;

//This is a community convention, not a rule.
