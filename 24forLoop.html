   /*  JavaScript for loop statement */
//The for loop statement creates a loop with three optional expressions. The following illustrates the syntax of the for loop statement:

for (initializer; condition; iterator) {
    // statements
}
/*
1) initializer
The for statement executes the initializer only once the loop starts. Typically, you declare and initialize a local loop variable in the initializer.

2) condition
The condition is a boolean expression that determines whether the for should execute the next iteration.

The for statement evaluates the condition before each iteration. If the condition is true (or is not present), it executes the next iteration. Otherwise, it’ll end the loop.

3) iterator
The for statement executes the iterator after each iteration.

// JavaScript for loop
// In the for loop, the three expressions are optional. The following shows the for loop without any expressions:

for ( ; ; ) {
   // statements
}

/*JavaScript for loop examples*/
//Let’s take some examples of using the for loop statement.

// 1) A simple JavaScript for loop example
// The following example uses the for loop statement to show numbers from 1 to 4 to the console:

for (let i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

Output:

1
2
3
4

// How it works.
// First, declare a variable  counter and initialize it to 1.
// Second, display the value of counter in the console if counter is less than 5.
// Third, increase the value of counter by one in each iteration of the loop.

// 2) Using the JavaScript for loop without the initializer example
// The following example uses a for loop that has no initializer expression:

let i = 1;
for (; i < 10; i += 2) {
  console.log(i);
}

Output:

1
3
5
7
9

// 3) Using the JavaScript for loop without the condition example
// Similar to the initializer expression, the condition expression is optional. If you omit the condition expression, you need to use a break statement to terminate the loop.

for (let j = 1; ; j += 2) {
  console.log(j);
  if (j > 10) {
    break;
  }
}

Output:
1
3
5
7
9
11

// 3) Using the JavaScript for loop statement without any expression example
// All three expressions of the for loop statements are optional. Therefore, you can omit all of them. For example:

let j = 1;
for (;;) {
  if (j > 10) {
    break;
  }
  console.log(j);
  j += 2;
}

Output:
1
3
5
7
9

// 4) Using the JavaScript for loop without the loop body example
// JavaScript allows the for statement to have an empty statement. In this case, you place a semicolon (;) immediately after the for statement.

// For example, the following uses a for loop to calculate the sum of 10 numbers from 1 to 10:

let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i <= 9; i++, sum += i);
console.log(sum);

Output:
55
