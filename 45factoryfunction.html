   /*  the factory functions in JavaScript */
//A factory function is a function that returns a new object. The following creates a person object named person1:

// let person1 = {
//   firstName: 'John',
//   lastName: 'Doe',
//   getFullName() {
//     return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
//   },
// };

console.log(person1.getFullName());

Output:
//John Doe

//The person1 object has two properties: firstName and lastName, and one method getFullName() that returns the full name.

//Suppose that you need to create another similar object called person2, you can duplicate the code as follows:

// let person2 = {
//   firstName: 'Jane',
//   lastName: 'Doe',
//   getFullName() {
//     return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
//   },
// };

console.log(person2.getFullName());

Output:
//Jane Doe

//In this example, the person1 and person2 objects have the same properties and methods.

//The problem is that the more objects you want to create, the more duplicate code you have.

//To avoid copying the same code all over again, you can define a function that creates the person object:

function createPerson(firstName, lastName) {
  return {
    firstName: firstName,
    lastName: lastName,
    getFullName() {
      return firstName + ' ' + lastName;
    },
  };
}

//When a function creates and returns a new object, it is called a factory function. The createPerson() is a factory function because it returns a new person object.

//The following shows how to use the createPerson() factory function to create two objects person1 and person2:

function createPerson(firstName, lastName) {
  return {
    firstName: firstName,
    lastName: lastName,
    getFullName() {
      return firstName + ' ' + lastName;
    },
  };
}

// let person1 = createPerson('John', 'Doe');
// let person2 = createPerson('Jane', 'Doe');

console.log(person1.getFullName());
console.log(person2.getFullName());

//By using the factory function, you create any number of the person objects without duplicating code.

//When you create an object, the JavaScript engine allocates memory to it. If you create many person objects, the JavaScript engine needs lots of memory space to store these objects.

//However, each person object has a copy of the same getFullName() method. Itâ€™s not efficient memory management.

//To avoid duplicating the same getFullName() function in every object, you can remove the getFullName() method from the person object:

function createPerson(firstName, lastName) {
    return {
        firstName: firstName,
        lastName: lastName
    }
}

//And move this method to another object:

var personActions = {
  getFullName() {
    return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
  },
};

//And before calling the getFullName() method on the person object, you can assign the method of the personActions object to the person object as follows:

let person1 = createPerson('John', 'Doe');
let person2 = createPerson('Jane', 'Doe');

person1.getFullName = personActions.getFullName;
person2.getFullName = personActions.getFullName;

console.log(person1.getFullName());
console.log(person2.getFullName());

//This approach is not scalable if the object has many methods because you have to manually assign them individually. This is why the Object.create() method comes into play.


/*   The Object.create() method  */
//The Object.create() method creates a new object using an existing object as the prototype of the new object:

Object.create(proto, [propertiesObject])

//So you can use the Object.create() as follows:

var personActions = {
  getFullName() {
    return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
  },
};

function createPerson(firstName, lastName) {
  let person = Object.create(personActions);
  person.firstName = firstName;
  person.lastName = lastName;
  return person;
}

//Now, you can create person objects and call the methods of the personActions object:

let person1 = createPerson('John', 'Doe');
let person2 = createPerson('Jane', 'Doe');

console.log(person1.getFullName());
console.log(person2.getFullName());

//The code works perfectly fine. However, in practice, you will rarely use the factory functions. Instead, you use classes or constructor/prototype patterns.
