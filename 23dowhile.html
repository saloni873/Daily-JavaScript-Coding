  /*  JavaScript do…while statement */
//The do...while loop statement creates a loop that executes a block until a condition evaluates to false.

//Here’s the syntax of the do...while loop:

do {
  statement;
} while(expression);

//Unlike the while loop, the do-while loop always executes the statement at least once before evaluating the expression.

//Since the do...while loop evaluates expression after each iteration, it’s often referred to as a post-test loop.

//Inside the loop body, you need to make changes to some variables to ensure that the expression is false after some iterations. Otherwise, you’ll have an indefinite loop.

//Note that starting with ES6+, the trailing semicolon (;) after the while(expression) is optional. So you can use the following syntax:

do {
  statement;
} while(expression)

//In practice, you often use the do...while statement when you want to perform at least one iteration before checking the condition.

//JavaScript do while statement examples
//Let’s take some examples of using the do...while statement.

//Basic JavaScript do while statement example
//The following example uses the do...while statement to output five numbers from 0 to 4 to the console:

let count = 0;
do {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
} while (count < 5)

Output:

0
1
2
3
4
// In this example:
// First, declare and initialize the count variable to zero.
// Second, show the count and increase its value by one in each iteration until its value is greater or equal to 5.
// Using the do while statement to make a number-guessing game
// The following example uses the do...while statement to create a number guessing game.

// The script generates a random integer between 1 and 10. You have to make a number of guesses until your number matches the random number.

// generate a secret number between 1 and 10
const MIN = 1;
const MAX = 10;

let secretNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * (MAX - MIN + 1)) + MIN;

let guesses = 0; // for storing the number of guesses
let hint = ''; // for storing hint
let number = 0;
do {
  // get input from user
  let input = prompt(`Please enter a number between ${MIN} and ${MAX}` + hint);

  // get the integer
  number = parseInt(input);

  // increase the number of guesses
  guesses++;

  // check input number with the secret number provide hint if needed
  if (number > secretNumber) {
    hint = ', and less than ' + number;
  } else if (number < secretNumber) {
    hint = ', and greater than ' + number;
  } else if (number == secretNumber) {
    alert(`Bravo! you're correct after ${guesses} guess(es).`);
  }
} while (number != secretNumber);

// How it works.

// First, declare the MIN and MAX constants and initialize their values to 1 and 10:

// const MIN = 1;
// const MAX = 10;

// Second, use Math.random() function to generate a random floating-point number with the value in the range of 0 and 1 (inclusive of zero but not one).

// To generate a random number between MIN and MAX (exclusive), you use the following expression:

// Math.random() * (MAX - MIN + 1)

// However, the result is a floating-point number. Therefore, you need to use the Math.floor() function to convert it to an integer:

Math.floor(Math.random() * (MAX - MIN + 1))

// To generate a random number between min and max, you use the following expression:

// let secretNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * (MAX - MIN + 1)) + MIN;

// Third, define three variables for storing the number of guesses, hints, and user’s input number:

// let guesses = 0; // for storing the number of guesses
// let hint = ''; // for storing hint
// let number = 0;

// Fourth, use the prompt() function to get the input from the user:

// let input = prompt(`Please enter a number between ${MIN} and ${MAX}` + hint);

// Note that the prompt() function only works on web browsers. If you run the code in another environment such as Node.js, please check the corresponding function.

// The prompt() function returns a string, therefore, you need to use the parseInt() function to convert it to an integer:

// number = parseInt(input);

// Fifth, increment the number of guesses in each iteration:

// guesses++;
// Sixth, check the input number with the secret number (random) number and give a hint. If the numbers are matched, show the message using the alert() function:

// if (number > secretNumber) {
//   hint = ', and less than ' + number;
// } else if (number < secretNumber) {
//   hint = ', and greater than ' + number;
// } else if (number == secretNumber) {
//   alert(`Bravo! you're correct after ${guesses} guess(es).`);
// }

// Seventh, perform the next iteration until the number matches the secret number.

// while (number != secretNumber);
