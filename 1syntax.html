/*1. Whitespace
Whitespace refers to characters that provide the space between other characters. JavaScript has the following whitespace:
*Carriage return
*Space
*New Line
*tab
JavaScript engine ignores whitespace. However, you can use whitespace to format the code to make it easy to read and maintain.

The following JavaScript code doesnâ€™t use whitespace:*/
let formatted = true; if (formatted) {console.log('The code is easy to read');}

//It is equivalent to the following code that uses whitespace. Hence, this code is much easier to read:

let format = true;

if (format) {
  console.log('The code is easy to read');
}

//Note that JavaScript bundlers remove all whitespace from JavaScript files and put them into a single file for deployment. By doing this, JavaScript bundlers make the JavaScript code lighter and faster to load in web browsers.

/*2. Statements
A statement is a piece of code that either declares a variable or instructs the JavaScript engine to perform a task. A simple statement ends with a semicolon (;).
For example, the following declares a variable and shows it to the console:
*/
let message = "Welcome to JavaScript";
console.log(message);
/*3. Blocks
A block is a sequence of zero or more simple statements. A block is delimited by a pair of curly brackets {}. For example:
*/
if (window.localStorage) {
  console.log('The local storage is supported');
}

/*4. Identifiers
An identifier is a name you choose for variables, parameters, functions, classes, etc.

An identifier name starts with a letter (a-z, or A-Z), an underscore(_), or a dollar sign ($) and is followed by a sequence of characters including (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), and dollar signs ($).

Identifiers in JavaScript are case-sensitive. For example, the message is different from the Message.*/

/*5. Comments
Comments allow you to include notes or hints in JavaScript code. When executing the code, the JavaScript engine ignores the comments.

JavaScript supports both single-line and block comments.

Single-line comments - A single-line comment starts with two forward-slashes characters (//). It turns all the text following the // on the same line into a comment. For example:

// this is a single-line comment

Block comments - A delimited comment begins with a forward slash and asterisk /* and ends with the opposite 
as in the following example:

/* This is a block comment
that can span multiple lines */

/*
6. Expressions
An expression is a piece of code that evaluates to a value. For example:

2 + 1;

*/

/*
7. Keywords & Reserved words
JavaScript defines a list of reserved keywords that have specific uses. You cannot use the reserved keywords as identifiers.

The following table displays the JavaScript reserved words as defined in ECMA-262:

break	case	catch
continue	debugger	default
else	export	extends
function	if	import
new	return	super
throw	try	null
void	while	with
class	delete	finally
in	switch	typeof
yield	const	do
for	instanceof	this
var		
In addition to the reserved keywords, ECMA-252 also defines a list of future reserved words that cannot be used as identifiers:

enum	implements	let
protected	private	public
await	interface	package
implements	public
*/
