  /*  JavaScript anonymous functions */
//An anonymous function is a function without a name. The following shows how to define an anonymous function:

(function () {
   //...
});

//Note that if you don’t place the anonymous function inside the parentheses (), you’ll get a syntax error. The parentheses () make the anonymous function an expression that returns a function object.

//An anonymous function is not accessible after its initial creation. Therefore, you often need to assign it to a variable.

//For example, the following shows an anonymous function that displays a message:

let show = function() {
    console.log('Anonymous function');
};

show();

//In this example, the anonymous function has no name between the function keyword and parentheses ().

//Because we need to call the anonymous function later, we assign the anonymous function to the show variable.

//Since the whole assignment of the anonymous function to the show variable makes a valid expression, you don’t need to wrap the anonymous function inside the parentheses ().

//Using anonymous functions as arguments
//In practice, you often pass anonymous functions as arguments to other functions. For example:

setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('Execute later after 1 second')
}, 1000);

//In this example, we pass an anonymous function into the setTimeout() function. The setTimeout() function executes this anonymous function one second later.

//Note that functions are first-class citizens in JavaScript. Therefore, you can pass a function to another function as an argument.

//Immediately invoked function execution
//If you want to create a function and execute it immediately after the declaration, you can declare an anonymous function like this:

(function() {
    console.log('IIFE');
})();

Output:
IIFE

//How it works.

//First, define a function expression:
(function () {
    console.log('Immediately invoked function execution');
})

//This expression returns a function.

//Second, call the function by adding the trailing parentheses ():
(function () {
    console.log('Immediately invoked function execution');
})();

//Sometimes, you may want to pass arguments into an anonymous function, like this:

let person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe'
};

(function () {
    console.log(person.firstName + ' ' + person.lastName);
})(person);

Output:
//John Doe

//Arrow functions
//ES6 introduced arrow function expressions that provide a shorthand for declaring anonymous functions.

//For example, this function:

let showing = function () {
    console.log('Anonymous function');
};

//… can be shortened using the following arrow function:
//let showing = () => console.log('Anonymous function');

//Similarly, the following anonymous function:

let add = function (a, b) {
    return a + b;
};

//… is functionally equivalent to the following arrow function:
//let add = (a, b) => a + b;
