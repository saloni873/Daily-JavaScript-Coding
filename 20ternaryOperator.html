   /* JavaScript ternary operator */
//When you want to execute a block if a condition evaluates to true, you often use an if…else statement. For example:

// let age = 18;
// let message;

// if (age >= 16) {
//   message = 'You can drive.';
// } else {
//   message = 'You cannot drive.';
// }

console.log(message);

//In this example, we show a message that a person can drive if the age is greater than or equal to 16. Alternatively, you can use a ternary operator instead of the if-else statement like this:

// let age = 18;
// let message;

// age >= 16 ? (message = 'You can drive.') : (message = 'You cannot drive.');

console.log(message);

//Or you can use the ternary operator in an expression as follows:

// let age = 18;
// let message;

// message = age >= 16 ? 'You can drive.' : 'You cannot drive.';

console.log(message);

//Here’s the syntax of the ternary operator:
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;

//In this syntax, the condition is an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value, either true or false.

//If the condition is true, the first expression (expresionIfTrue) executes. If it is false, the second expression (expressionIfFalse) executes.

//The following shows the syntax of the ternary operator used in an expression:
let variableName = condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;

//In this syntax, if the condition is true, the variableName will take the result of the first expression (expressionIfTrue) or expressionIfFalse otherwise.

//JavaScript ternary operator examples
//Let’s take some examples of using the ternary operator.

/*
1) Using the JavaScript ternary operator to perform multiple statements
The following example uses the ternary operator to perform multiple operations, where each operation is separated by a comma. For example:
*/
let authenticated = true;
let nextURL = authenticated
  ? (alert('You will redirect to admin area'), '/admin')
  : (alert('Access denied'), '/403');

// redirect to nextURL here
console.log(nextURL); // '/admin'

//In this example, the returned value of the ternary operator is the last value in the comma-separated list.
/*
2) Simplifying ternary operator example
See the following example:

let locked = 1;
let canChange = locked != 1 ? true : false;

If the locked is 1, then the canChange variable is set to false, otherwise, it is set to true. In this case, you can simplify it by using a Boolean expression as follows:

let locked = 1;
let canChange = locked != 1;
*/

/*
3) Using multiple JavaScript ternary operators example
The following example shows how to use two ternary operators in the same expression:
*/
let speed = 90;
let message = speed >= 120 ? 'Too Fast' : speed >= 80 ? 'Fast' : 'OK';

console.log(message);

Output:
Fast

//It’s a good practice to use the ternary operator when it makes the code easier to read. If the logic contains many if...else statements, you should avoid using the ternary operators.
