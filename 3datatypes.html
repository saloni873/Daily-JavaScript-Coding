// <!-- JavaScript Data Types -->
// JavaScript has the primitive data types:

// 1.null
// 2.undefined
// 3.boolean
// 4.number
// 5.string
// 6.symbol – available from ES2015
// 7.bigint – available from ES2020
// and a complex data type object.

//JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning that a variable isn’t associated with a specific type. In other words, a variable can hold a value of different types. For example:

let counter = 120; // counter is a number
counter = false;   // counter is now a boolean
counter = "foo";   // counter is now a string

//To determine the current type of the value stored in a variable, you use the typeof operator:

let count = 120;
console.log(typeof(count)); // "number"

count = false; 
console.log(typeof(count)); // "boolean"

count = "Hi";
console.log(typeof(count)); // "string"

//The undefined type
//The undefined type is a primitive type that has only one value undefined. By default, when a variable is declared but not initialized, it defaults to undefined.

//Consider the following example:
let counts;
console.log(counts);        // undefined
console.log(typeof counts); // undefined

//In this example, the counts is a variable. Since counts hasn’t been initialized, it is assigned the value undefined. The type of counts is also undefined.

//It’s important to note that the typeof operator also returns undefined when you call it on a variable that hasn’t been declared:

console.log(typeof undeclaredVar); // undefined

//The null type
//The null type is the second primitive data type that also has only one value null. For example:

let obj = null;
console.log(typeof obj); // object

// JavaScript defines that null is equal to undefined as follows:
console.log(null == undefined); // true

//The number type
//JavaScript uses the number type to represent both integer and floating-point numbers.

//The following statement declares a variable and initializes its value with an integer:

let num = 100;

//To represent a floating-point number, you include a decimal point followed by at least one number. For example:

let price = 12.5; 
let discount = 0.05;

//Note that JavaScript automatically converts a floating-point number into an integer if the number appears to be a whole number.

//The reason is that Javascript always wants to use less memory since a floating-point value uses twice as much memory as an integer value. For example:

let rate = 200.00; // interpreted as an integer 200

//To get the range of the number type, you use Number.MIN_VALUE and Number.MAX_VALUE. For example:
console.log(Number.MAX_VALUE); // 1.7976931348623157e+308
console.log(Number.MIN_VALUE); // 5e-324


// Also, you can use Infinity and -Infinity to represent the infinite number. For example:

console.log(Number.MAX_VALUE + Number.MAX_VALUE); // Infinity
console.log(-Number.MAX_VALUE - Number.MAX_VALUE); // -Infinity

//NaN
//NaN stands for Not a Number. It is a special numeric value that indicates an invalid number. For example, the division of a string by a number returns NaN:.

console.log('a'/2); // NaN;

//The NaN has two special characteristics:

//*Any operation with NaN returns NaN.
//*The NaN does not equal any value, including itself.
// Here are some examples:

console.log(NaN/2); // NaN
console.log(NaN == NaN); // false

//The string type
//In JavaScript, a string is a sequence of zero or more characters. A string literal begins and ends with either a single quote(') or a double quote (").

//A string that begins with a double quote must end with a double quote, and a string that begins with a single quote must also end with a single quote. For example:
let greeting = 'Hi';
let message  = "Bye";

// If you want to use single quotes or double quotes in a literal string, you need to use the backslash to escape them. For example:
let msg = 'I\'m also a valid string'; // use \ to escape the single quote (')


// JavaScript strings are immutable, meaning that they cannot be modified once created. However, you can create a new string from an existing one. For example:
let str = 'JavaScript';
str = str + ' String';

//In this example:

// First, declare the str variable and initialize it to a string of 'JavaScript'.
// Second, use the + operator to combine 'JavaScript' with ' String' to make its value as 'Javascript String'.
// Behind the scene, the JavaScript engine creates a new string that holds the new string 'JavaScript String' and destroys the original strings 'JavaScript' and ' String'.

//The following example attempts to modify the first character of the string JavaScript:
let s = 'JavaScript';
s[0] = 'j';
console.log(s)

// The boolean type
//The boolean type has two literal values: true and false in lowercase. The following example declares two variables that hold the boolean values.

let inProgress = true;
let completed = false;

console.log(typeof completed); // boolean

//JavaScript allows values of other types to be converted into boolean values of true or false.

//To convert values of other types into boolean values, you use the Boolean() function.

console.log(Boolean('Hi'));// true
console.log(Boolean(''));  // false

console.log(Boolean(20));  // true
console.log(Boolean(Infinity));  // true
console.log(Boolean(0));  // false

console.log(Boolean({foo: 100}));  // true on non-empty object
console.log(Boolean(null));// false

//The symbol type
//JavaScript introduced a new primitive type in ES6: the symbol. Unlike other primitive types, the symbol type does not have a literal form.

//To create a symbol, you call the Symbol function as follows:
let s1 = Symbol();

//The Symbol function creates a new unique value every time you call it.
console.log(Symbol() == Symbol()); // false

//The bigint type
//The bigint type represents the whole numbers that are larger than 253 – 1. To form a bigint literal number, you append the letter n at the end of the number:
let pageView = 9007199254740991n;
console.log(typeof(pageView)); // 'bigint'


//The object type
//In JavaScript, an object is a collection of properties, where each property is defined as a key-value pair.

//The following example defines an empty object using the object literal syntax:
let emptyObject = {};

//The following example defines the person object with two properties: firstName and lastName.
let person = {
    firstName: 'Saloni',
    lastName: 'Gautam'
};

//A property name of an object can be any string. You can use quotes around the property name if it is not a valid identifier.

//For example, if the person object has a property first-name, you must place it in the quotes such as "first-name".

//A property of an object can hold an object. For example:
let contact = {
    firstName: 'Saloni',
    lastName: 'Gautam',
    email: 'saloni.gautam@example.com',
    phone: '(408)-555-9999',
    address: {
        building: '4000',
        street: 'North 1st street',
        city: 'Surat',
        state: 'Gujrat',
        country: 'India'
    }
}

//The contact object has the firstName, lastName, email, phone, and address properties.

//The address property itself holds an object that has building,  street, city, state, and country properties.

//To access an object’s property, you can use

//*The dot notation (.)
//*The array-like notation ([]).
//The following example uses the dot notation (.) to access the firstName and lastName properties of the contact object.
console.log(contact.firstName);
console.log(contact.lastName);

//If you reference a property that does not exist, you’ll get an undefined value. For example:
console.log(contact.age); // undefined

//The following example uses the array-like notation to access the email and phone properties of the contact object.
console.log(contact['phone']); 
console.log(contact['email']);
