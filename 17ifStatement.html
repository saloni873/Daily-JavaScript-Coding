   /* JavaScript if statement */
//The if statement executes block if a condition is true. The following shows the syntax of the if statement:

if( condition )
   statement;

//The condition can be a value or an expression. Typically, the condition evaluates to a boolean value, which is true or false.

//If the condition evaluates to true, the if statement executes the statement. Otherwise, the if statement passes the control to the next statement after it.

//If the condition is a non-boolean value, JavaScript will coerce it to a boolean value by calling the Boolean() function.

//If you have more than one statement to execute, you need to wrap them in a block using a pair of curly braces ({}) as follows:

if (condition) {
  // statements to execute
}

//It’s a good practice to always use curly braces with the if statement. This makes your code easier to maintain and helps avoid possible mistakes.

//JavaScript if statement examples
//The following example uses the if statement to check if the age is equal to or greater than 18:

let age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log('You can sign up');
}

Output:
//You can sign up

// How it works.
// First, declare and initialize the variable age to 18:  

// let age = 18;

//Second, check if the age is greater or equal to 18 using the if statement. Because the expression age >= 18 is true, the code inside the if statement executes that outputs a message to the console:

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log('You can sign up');
}

//The following example also uses the if statement. However, the age is 16 which causes the condition to be evaluated to false. Therefore, you won’t see any message in the output:

// let age = 16;
// if (age >= 18) {
//   console.log('You can sign up');
// }

/*Nested if statement*/
//It’s possible to use an if statement inside another if statement. For example:

// let age = 16;
// let state = 'CA';

// if (state == 'CA') {
//   if (age >= 16) {
//     console.log('You can drive.');
//   }
// }

//Output:
//You can drive.

// How it works.
// First, declare and initialize the age and state variables:
// let age = 16;
// let state = 'CA';

// Second, check if the state is 'CA' using an if statement. If yes, check if the age is greater than 16 using a nested if statement and output a message to the console:

// if (state == 'CA') {
//   if (age == 16) {
//     console.log('You can drive.');
//   }
// }

//In practice, you should avoid using nested if statements as much as possible.

//For example, you can use the logical AND operator && to combine the conditions and use an if statements as follows:

// let age = 16;
// let state = 'CA';

// if (state == 'CA' && age == 16) {
//   console.log('You can drive.');
// }
